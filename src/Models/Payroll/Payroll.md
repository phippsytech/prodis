## Payroll Issues

# Leave

When annual leave was deducted from staff it included the leave loading amount.

Thoughts:

I think I need to keep the original leave request and when it is created in 
Xero, reference the leave record id so that changes to leave update that record.

Then, when I calculate the Ordinary Hours, I use the leave data in NDISmate
rather than in Xero.

All Annual Leave requests need to be approved.

# Salary Sacrifice

I need to add an additional field for the amount that was provided by CBB versus
the adjusted amount.  This is so I can "replay" the salary sacrifice entry when 
generating payslips.  When exporting the CBB file I need to use the adjusted 
amount.

# Hours per day

Not all staff are 7.6 hours per day.  For example, Nalda works 3 days a week,
5 hours a day, not 7.6.

This only becomes relevant when calculating leave I think.
