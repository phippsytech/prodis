MYOB Integration

I have a developer account with MYOB 

I want to consume the MYOB Business API
api.myob.com

Here are a bunch of websites that came up when searching for MYOB API PHP


The official online api resource:

[Title](https://github.com/squarecloudlabs/myob-php-sdk) <-- this looks promising

// this repo uses the openapi but is API version 1.0.  It is attractive because it does follow similar syntax to Xero.

This looks like an official tumblr account for MYOB, which is just bizarre.
