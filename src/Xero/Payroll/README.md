There is a pay item called ordinary rate.
Each staff member has a negotiated hourly rate that gets paid using this pay item.

This is currently stored in the pay template in Xero.

Staff are either full-time or casual.  
Full time staff probably have a pay template that outlines the way they get paid.

There is a bonus payment that is paid for any hours worked over the KPI.  That seems to be a static $60 per hour

tracey gets a bonus raTE AT HER HOURLY RATE.  I don't know what she gets paid a bonus for though.

There is also a referral bonus that gets paid at a flat $100 per referral.
