Documents:

Be able to upload any documents, not just fixed type.

Where we have document types:
Need multiple staff to be able to provide their version of the same document (eg Progress Report for a service)
Question - is a service our product, or a Support Category Item?


The commission is not really interested in older documents.  Need to have an upload date for documents.
Documents don't necessarily need an expiry date.  They may have a review date instead.
(if they do, who gets notified that the document is due for review.  How do we mark that the document has been reviewed?)

Training register:
Part of credentials - there will be times when the commission want all staff to undertake certain training.
We need a register to show that this training has been completed, uploading evidence that the training has been done.



Low priority, but the availability system needs to actually work.

Avoiding having documents download in favour of documents just being viewed in the CRM
